Algorithmic Trading Strategy

Welcome to the repository! This project demonstrates an algorithmic trading strategy, meticulously designed and backtested on market data from the GB electricity market.The strategy simulates trades during 
specific trading windows and evaluates key performance metrics like Net Profit and Sharpe Ratio. While originally tailored for electricity markets, the methodology is versatile and can be adapted 
to other financial markets, including equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

Key Insights  

Daily Patterns:  
- Morning & Evening Peaks (4–7 AM, 7–9 PM) show consistent price surges due to demand spikes.  
- Weekday Volatility is higher on Tuesdays and Thursdays, driven by industrial activity.  
- Weekend Stability is observed, particularly on Saturdays.

Proposed Trading Strategy  

This trading strategy leverages key market behaviors to maximize profitability:  

- Trading Hours: Simulates 24/7 market participation.  
- Entry Points:  
  - Night Period (3–5 AM): Buy during low demand.  
  - Morning Window (4–7 AM): Sell during demand surges.  
  - Evening Window (6–9 PM): Buy early evening, sell at peak volatility.  

Risk Controls:  
- Implementation of stop-loss orders to mitigate downside risks.  
- Integration of real-time weather and renewable output data for dynamic adjustments.  

Backtesting Results:  
- Net Profit: £22,987.52 (23% return on an initial £100,000 capital)  
- Sharpe Ratio: 4.27 (indicating strong risk-adjusted returns)

Strategy Overview  

The trading methodology focuses on the following windows to exploit market opportunities effectively:  

| Trading Window   | Time Range     | Objective                                    |  
|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| Night Trading    | 03:00–05:00    | Buy at lower prices during low demand.       |  
| Morning Trading  | 04:00–07:00    | Sell at higher prices during demand ramp-up. |  
| Evening Trading  | 18:00–19:00    | Buy to capture evening demand increases.     |  
| Peak Volatility  | 20:00–21:00    | Sell during high price volatility.           |  

Transaction Costs: Assumes a 0.1% cost per trade.
